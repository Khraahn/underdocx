        <h1>Underdocx User Guide</h1>

        This Guide will describe what Underdocx exactly is, how this framework can be used in your project,
        how templates can be defined and how custom data can be provided for document generation.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>Document Template Engine</h3>
        Underdocx is an extremely extendable open source Java framework to manipulate multiple types of
        Documents, for example ODT text documents (LibreOffice/OpenOffice Writer),
        ODG Graphics (LibreOffice/OpenOffice Draw), ODP Presentations (LibreOffice/OpenOffice Impress), ODS Spreadsheets
        (LibreOffice/OpenOffice Calc) and all plain text files as TXT, HTML, Scripts etc.
        It uses different types of parameterizable placeholders that will be replaced by custom texts, images, tables
        and even other documents. This allows you to define "components" that can be easily reused. Underdocx also
        allows
        you to define custom placeholders to provide custom functionalities.
        Also documents can be converted directly to PDF if LibreOffice has been installed on the system.<br>
        <br>
        Underdox is a Template Engine or Template Processor. It receives template documents and data and combines it
        to generate the concrete document. This is a simplified overview that Underdocx does:
        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/overview.png" /></div>

        Templates and data can be combined by a simple programming interface (API), but Underdocx can
        also be used as standalone command line tool (CLI).

        <h3>Open Source</h3>
        Underdocx is free and uses the
        <a href="https://github.com/winterrifier/underdocx/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">MIT
          License</a>.<br>
        The Source Code is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/winterrifier/underdocx" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<br>
        Releases are provided by
        <a href="https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.winterrifier/underdocx" target="_blank">Maven Central
          Repository</a>.<br>
        This documentation and more information can be found at
        <a href="https://underdocx.org" target="_blank">Underdocx.org</a>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <h3>Add dependency</h3>

        Add Underdocx as dependency to your project, for example in Maven extend your pom.xml:

        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-xml hljs" data-lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.github.winterrifier&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;underdocx&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;0.12.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>

        When you use Gradle your dependency should look like this

        <pre class="padding"><code>implementation 'io.github.winterrifier:underdocx:0.12.1'</code></pre>

        You can also visit <a href="https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.winterrifier/underdocx"
          target="_blank">
          Underdocx on Maven Central Repository</a>.<br> to find more snippets how to include underdocx
        into your project.

        <h3>Hello Word Example</h3>

        Now you can use this code to create a simple template that will be
        processed by the template engine:

        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    OdtContainer doc = new OdtContainer("Hello ${$name}");
    OdtEngine engine = new OdtEngine();
    engine.pushVariable("name", "World");
    engine.run(doc);
    File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("Test_", ".odt");
    doc.save(tmpFile);
    System.out.println("Document created: %s".formatted(tmpFile));
  }
}</code></pre>
        This code will create a ODT-document with prefix "Test_" in your temp folder that contains the text "Hello World"


        <h2>Principles</h2>

        <h3>Technical abstraction</h3>

        Depending on your software project, multiple teams with different knowledge can be involved when Underdocx is
        used:
        <ul>
          <li>The Template documents could be created by customers without knowledge about software development.
            Technical
            details can be hidden behind simple placeholders.</li>
          <li>Additional importable document "fragments" can also be provided and used by the customer or by the
            software development team
            that define document fragments as reusable components, similar to components used in web development.</li>
          <li>The data used to fill the templates can be provided by customer, by the software development team or any
            third party </li>
          <li>Software developers are responsible to use the Underdocx API to combine data and templates</li>
          <li>Software developers can also extend Underdocx with custom placeholders and functionalities to simplify or
            improve
            definition of templates</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/templateengine_roles.png" /></div>

        <h3>Use Cases</h3>

        <h4>Example Use Case: Reporting</h4>
        As describe above, Underdocx can be used to create individual software solutions where different
        roles can apply data and templates through a Web App. This Web App may also allow other users to generate
        report-documents after selecting data that shall be visualized.

        <h4>Example Use Case: Web Shop</h4>

        Underdocx might also be used by software developers to simply generate PDF documents based on templates.
        In this example a Web App has been implemented. Its Backend uses predefined
        templates to let Underdocx generate invoice-documents that can be downloaded by
        the user.
        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/exampleWebShop.png" /></div>

        <h4>Example Use Case: Translatable Graphics</h4>

        Underdocx might be used as a translation tool, taking a document or graphics with placeholders
        that shall be replaced by translations or other images. Underdocx also takes the translation
        data, provided by translation files, and generates the documents or graphics in multiple
        translated variants.
        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/ExampleTranslation.png" /></div>

        <h3>Placeholders</h3>

        Underdocx uses placeholders to replace them with text or other document components.
        It provides a predefined placeholder syntax and predefined parameterizable placeholders,
        so called "commands". The default syntax of placeholders is as follows:
        <pre class="padding"><code>${Key}
${Key attr1:value1}
${Key attr1:value1, "attr2":value2}</code></pre>

        Actually the syntax is derived from the JSON-syntax, which allows definition of complex attribute values.
        Here are some example of placeholders that are supported by default:
        <pre class="padding"><code>${Date}
${Date value:"2022-01-05", outputFormat:"dd.MM.yyyy"}
${For value:[{firstName: "Hans", lastName:"Müller"}, {firstName: "Jon", lastName:"Doe"}], $as:"person"}</code></pre>

        Underdocx also supports placeholders of different kinds. For example images can be defined to be
        placeholders for other images. Also Underdocx can be extended to define custom placeholders with different
        syntax.

        <h3>Model, Variables and Values</h3>

        There are three ways how templates can address data that shall be used.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Values</b> are directly provided as placeholder attributes that do
            not use prefixes characters like '*' and '$'.</li>
          <li><b>Variables</b> are stored values, added though the engine API
            but also dynamically created during template processing.
            The Attribute-Prefix '$' is associated with variables, which means the attribute refers to a variable</li>
          <li>The <b>Model</b>-tree defines a static data structure the engine can walk through.
            This data type is optional.
            The Attribute-Prefix '*' is associated with the model, which means the attribute
            points to a node of the model-data-tree</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Values</h4>

        Values are placeholder attribute values that are directly defined and used by the placeholder itself, for
        example this document content:
        <pre class="padding"><code>Example: ${Date value:"2022-01-05" outputFormat:"dd.MM.yyyy"}</code></pre>
        will always be replaced by this text:
        <pre class="padding"><code>Example: 05.01.2022</code></pre>
        because the value of the date and the output format to use are defined directly in the placeholder as values.

        <h4>Variables</h4>

        A simple way to import data to the template engine are the definition of variables that can be
        accessed by the placeholders. Usually the attribute prefix '$' indicates access to a variable. For example,
        the given text:
        <pre class="padding"><code>Example: ${Date $value:"dateToShow" outputFormat:"dd.MM.yyyy"}</code></pre>
        and the code snippet:
        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">String lastYear = LocalDate.now().minusYear(1)
          .format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd"));
engine.pushVariable("dateToShow", lastYear);</code></pre>
        will generate a document with the date one year ago, which has been stored in the variable "dateToShow".
        For example:
        <pre class="padding"><code>Example: 19.01.2024</code></pre>

        <h4>Variable referencing Variable</h4>
        In some cases it might be useful that a variable stores the name/address of an other variable.
        This variable reference can be resolved with prefix '$$'.
        The following example stores the value "Hello World" in variable "out", and Variable "reference" stores
        the variable name "out". The prefix '$$' is used to resolve "reference" and to print out "Hello World" directly.
        <pre class="padding"><code>${Push key:"out", value:"Hello World"}
${Push key:"reference", value:"out"}
${String $$value:"reference"}</code></pre>


        <h4>Model</h4>

        The model is a static hierarchical data structure the template engine can navigate through during
        template processing. It has one unnamed root node, therefore it is not possible to register
        multiple models. Existing tree nodes won't usually change their value.
        The Template Engine always has a current position within the model tree that may
        change during template processing (for example in for-loops). References to
        model nodes are always relatively to the engines current model tree position.
        The usage of models is optional, you might also use variables.
        This example shows how to register a model and how to address a node:
        <pre class="padding"><code>Example: ${Date *value:"persons[1].birthday" outputFormat:"dd.MM.yyyy"}</code></pre>
        and this code snippet:
        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">DataNode model = new MapDataNode("""
          {
              persons: [
                  {birthday: "1975-05-14"},
                  {birthday: "2021-03-07"}
              ]
          }
      """);
engine.setModel(model);</code></pre>
        will always generate a document with content:
        <pre class="padding"><code>Example: 07.03.2021</code></pre>
        In this example,
        the model is defined by using the JSON syntax, which is converted to a data-tree using the
        <code-word>MapDataNode</code-word>-class.
        The <code-word>*value</code-word> parameter uses the model-path-syntax to address a certain node in the model
        data tree.

        <h4>DataPath-Syntax</h4>

        Variables and models can store hierarchical data. The DataPath-Syntax can be used to address certain
        (sub-)nodes in the tree, or even to address parent nodes. There is an overview of characters that have
        a special meaning:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Character</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>.</td>
            <td>introduces the next hierarchy level</td>
            <td>a.b</td>
            <td>access to the value "b" which is a child node of "a"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>[ ]</td>
            <td>selects an item of a list </td>
            <td><no-br>persons[1]</no-br></td>
            <td>access to the second item of a list named "persons"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>^</td>
            <td>selects the root node</td>
            <td><no-br>x^a.b</no-br></td>
            <td>access to node "b" which is child of node "a". Node "x" will be ignored</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&lt;</td>
            <td>selects the parent node</td>
            <td><no-br>a.b.c&lt;d</no-br></td>
            <td>access to node "d" which is child of "b"</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>API Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Document Types</h3>
        <h4>OdtContainer / OdtEngine</h4>
        <code-word>OdtContainer</code-word> instances represent an ODT document which can be modified by
        the <code-word>OdtEngine</code-word> or by user. <code-word>OdtContainer</code-word> provides multiple
        constructors to load
        or create documents.
        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    // creates an empty document
    new OdtContainer(); 
    // creates a document with two paragraphs "Hello World" and "How are you?"
    new OdtContainer("Hello World\nHow are you?"); 
    // loads an ODT file
    new OdtContainer(new File("file.odt"));
  }
}</code></pre>
        <code-word>OdtEngine</code-word> is the main class to process a ODT document, exchange its placeholder and to
        register custom extensions to provide more placeholders or functionalities. This
        example registers variable "name" at the engine and
        processes a text document containing a single placeholder. A file is created
        that contains text "Hello World"
        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
   OdtContainer doc = new OdtContainer("Hello ${$name}");
   OdtEngine engine = new OdtEngine();
   engine.pushVariable("name", "World");
   engine.run(doc);
   File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("Test_", ".odt");
   doc.save(tmpFile);
  }
}</code></pre>


        <h4>OdgContainer / OdgEgnine</h4>
        <code-word>OdgContainer</code-word> and <code-word>OdgEngine</code-word> are responsible for
        ODG Graphics documents (LibreOffice Draw).
        These documents consists of pages that contain multiple graphic elements.
        The Engine will process the contained placeholders from first to last page and from background to foreground.
        Tip: Create an initial page that defines some initial useful ${Alias} commands and ${For}-Loops referring tables
        by their names and let this page remove with help of the ${Remove} command.

        <h4>OdpContainer / OdpEngine</h4>
        These instances represent are responsible for ODP Presentation documents (LibreOffice Impress).
        Structure and usage of these classes are quite similar to
        <code-word>OdgContainer</code-word>/<code-word>OdgEngine</code-word>

        <h4>OdsContainer / OdsEngine</h4>
        <code-word>OdsContainer</code-word> instances represent an ODS Spreadsheet document (LibreOffice Calc).
        It consists of names tables that may contain placeholders in their cells.
        The <code-word>OdsEngine</code-word> will process the contained placeholders from first to last table
        from left to right and from top to bottom.
        It supports all commands except <code-word>${Import}</code-word> and <code-word>${Export}</code-word>
        Tip: Create an initial spreadsheet that defines some initial useful ${Alias} commands and ${For}-Loops referring
        tables
        by their names and let this spreadsheet remove with help of the ${Remove} command.

        <h4>TxtContainer / TxtEngine</h4>
        <code-word>TxtEngine</code-word> and <code-word>OdgEngine</code-word> are responsible for
        all types of plain text files, for example .txt, .html, .sh etc.
        The <code-word>TxtEngine</code-word> supports all commands except
        <code-word>${Export}</code-word>, <code-word>${Image}</code-word> and <code-word>${Remove}</code-word>.
        The <code-word>${For}</code-word>-command does not supported attributes <code-word>rowNumber</code-word>
        and <code-word>listItem</code-word>

        <h3>Resource</h3>

        <code-word>Resource</code-word> is an interface that represents data that can be loaded. This interface is
        important
        for command like <code-word>${Import}</code-word>, <code-word>${Export}</code-word> and
        <code-word>${Image}</code-word> that load images or other
        documents to include them into the template. There are default implementation to convert URLs,
        Files or binary data into <code-word>Resource</code-word>-instances
        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">// Creates a Resource instance based on a file
Resource resource = new Resource.FileResource(String file);
// Creates a Resource instance based on a file
Resource resource = new Resource.FileResource(File file);
// Creates a Resource instance based on binary data
Resource resource = new Resource.DataResource(byte[] data);
// Creates a Resource instance based on an URI/URL
Resource resource = new Resource.UriResource(String uri);
// Creates a Resource instance based on an URI/URL
Resource resource = new Resource.UriResource(URI uri);
// Creates a Resource instance based on a Base64 encoded String
Resource resource = new Resource.Base64Resource(String b64Data);      </code></pre>

        <h3>DataNode</h3>

        All type of values (model and variables) are stored as a tree structure that implement the
        interface <code-word>DataNode</code-word>. You can write your own implementation to provide data to the engine.
        But there are also some predefined implementation you can easily use, such as
        <code-word>MapDataNode</code-word>, <code-word>DataTreeBuilder</code-word> and
        <code-word>ReflectionDataNode</code-word>

        <h4>MapDataNode</h4>
        Use <code-word>MapDataNode</code-word> to manually register values in a map. These values might also
        be maps, lists or single (leaf) values. <code-word>MapDataNode</code-word> also allows to convert
        JSON text into DataNodes. The following example uses a JSON to create a <code-word>DataNode</code-word>
        that is stored as variable "persons". The resulting document will contain text "Hello Jenny"

        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    DataNode persons = new MapDataNode("""{
      persons: [
        {name: "Hans"},
        {name: "Jenny"}
      ]}
    """);
    OdtContainer doc = new OdtContainer("Hello ${$persons[1].name}");
    OdtEngine engine = new OdtEngine();
    engine.pushVariable("persons", persons);
    engine.run(doc);
    File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("Test_", ".odt");
    doc.save(tmpFile);
  }
}</code></pre>

        <h4>DataTreeBuilder</h4>

        The <code-word>DataTreeBuilder</code-word> provides a fluent API to build up a tree data structure. It helps
        to construct structures that can not be expressed by JSON, for example structures that
        contains non-primitive objects. The next example create a list of persons that contain
        <code-word>Resource</code-word>-objects representing images.
        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">private DataNode createPersonsData() throws IOException {
  Resource resource1 = new Resource.FileResource("image1.png");
  Resource resource2 = new Resource.FileResource("image2.png");
  DataNode data = DataTreeBuilder
    .beginList()
      .beginMap()
        .add("firstName", "Hans")
        .add("lastName", "Müller")
        .add("birthDate", "1975-02-01")
        .add("imageTitle", "Hans")
        .add("imageName", "hans.png")
        .addObj("imageResource", resource1)
      .end()
       
      .beginMap()
        .add("firstName", "Helene")
        .add("lastName", "Schäfer")
        .add("birthDate", "2009-05-03")
        .add("imageTitle", "Helene")
        .add("imageName", "helene.png")
        .addObj("imageResource", resource2)
      .end()
        
    .end()
  .build();
        
 return data;
}</code></pre>

        <h4>ReflectionDataNode</h4>

        <code-word>ReflectionDataNode</code-word> provides a convenient way to convert any object
        dynamically to DataNode instances. Fields and get methods are
        called by the java reflection API to build up the tree dynamically.

        Additionally the definition of <code-word>Resolver</code-word> allows to dynamically
        simulate fields that are not provided by the reflected object. This
        allows injection of additional data to the model node that is not
        provided by its origin object.

        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">private static class TestClassA {
  public TestClassB b = new TestClassB();
}
      
private static class TestClassB {
  public List&lt;String&gt; getC() {
    return Arrays.asList("Item1", "Item2");
  }
}
      
public static void main (String[] args) {
  String content = """
    ${*b.x}
    ${*b.c[0]}
  """;
  OdtContainer doc = new OdtContainer(content);
  ReflectionDataNode.Resolver resolver = (object, name) -> 
    name.equals("x")
    ? java.util.Optional.of(new LeafDataNode("42"))
    : Optional.empty();
  OdtEngine engine = new OdtEngine();
  engine.setModel(new TestClassA(), resolver);
  engine.run(doc);
  File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("Test_", ".odt");
  doc.save(tmpFile);
}</code></pre>

        This snippet will create a document with content:

        <pre class="padding"><code>42
Item1
</code></pre>
        Reason: <code-word>${*b.c[0]}</code-word> is a placeholder to print out model node addresses by DataPath
        <code-word>b.c[0]</code-word>.
        Also <code-word>${*b.x}</code-word> is a placeholder to print out model node addresses by DataPath "b.x".
        The call of <code-word>engine.setModel(new TestClassA())</code-word> creates an instance of TestClassA and
        converts it into a ReflectionDataNode. This node is now declared as model data.
        The Additional "resolver" provides value 42 when property "x"
        is requested by a placeholder. "x" is not part of the reflected classes.

        <h4>ReferredDataNode</h4>
        This <code-word>DataNode</code-word>-Wrapper takes a <code-word>Supplier&lt;DataNode&gt;</code-word>
        to dynamically provide a <code-word>DataNode</code-word> on request.

        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">engine.pushVariable("data",

        <h2>Predefined Commands</h2>

        Underdocx provides multiple predefined placeholders and attributes to enable some basic
        functions.

        <h3>${String}-Command</h3>

        The placeholder with keyword String is used to be replaced with text. The text can be taken
        from a variable, model or directly from attribute. Attribute <code-word>value</code-word> refers
        to the text value that has to be printed. There are also shortcuts of the command
        as you can see in the example below. The String command
        supports multiple attributes. These attributes can also be used in the shortcut versions.

        <h3>${For}-Command</h3>

        Placeholder keyword "For" introduces a loops. There are different loop implementations. You can repeat
        multiple paragraphs, rows of a table or items of a list.
        Also there are some differences how to receive the iterable data and how to access the current item during
        iteration. Every <code-word>${For}</code-word>-Command must have a corresponding
        <code-word>${EndFor}</code-word> command to define a repeatable area.

        This is just an overview of provided attributes, see details in the next sections
        <table>
          <tr>

        <h4>Loops over model, variables or values</h4>
        Similar to the String command there is a mandatory <code-word>value</code-word>-Attribute, that addresses
        the list of items to walk though. The attribute may refer a variable, a model node or directly use the
        attribute value. Additionally you can (or maybe have to)
        use the <code-word>as</code-word> attribute to make the current item accessible by a name. The usage of
        <code-word>as</code-word> depends on how
        the attribute <code-word>value</code-word> is used.

              The list is accessed through model property "list". During iteration, a prefix "it" is registered that
              represents the current list item. This item is printed out by command ${*it}. Also, the current item
              becomes the current model position aka current model node. The Variable “index” stores the current item
              index.

              The list is accessed through model property "list". During iteration the current item becomes the current
              model position aka current model node. When no "as"-attribute is used, the current model node can be
              printed with command ${*}. The Variable “index” stores the current item index.

        </table>

        <h4>Loop of Tablerows</h4>

        To repeat table rows, a template-table has to be placed between the <code-word>${For}</code-word> and
        the <code-word>${EndFor}</code-word>-command. The mandatory attribute <code-word>tableRow</code-word> defines
        which row index or range of rows shall be repeated. Also the optional attribute
        <code-word>rowGroupSize</code-word>
        defines how may of these rows belong to a single list item.<br>
        <br>
        The example below uses the <code-word>${Push}</code-word>-Command to define
        a variable "data" that contains a list of person objects.
        The <code-word>${For}</code-word>-command uses this "data"-list to generate a table.
        <code-word>tableRow:[2,7]</code-word> indicates that indices 2 to 7 are
        used for the loops. Attribute <code-word>rowGroupSize:3</code-word> ensures each item receives 3
        rows of the repeatable rows.
        As you can see in the example, cells of multiple rows can be merged as long
        they are part of one group. Placeholder <code-word>${Counter}</code-word> prints the current loop iteration

        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/tableLoopGroup.png" /></div>
        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/tableLoopGroupResult.png" /></div>

        When the table can not be placed between <code-word>${For}</code-word> and <code-word>${EndFor}</code-word>
        (for example in Spreadsheets), you can use the attribute <code-word>tableName</code-word> to address the
        target table, or you can use <code-word>parentTable:true</code-word> to address the table in which the
        command is located in. In both cases ensure the <code-word>${EndFor}</code-word> command directly follows
        the <code-word>${For}</code-word> command.

        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/ForTableName.png" /></div>

        To style table cells use Attribute <code-word>templaceCell</code-word> of several commands. It
        might be useful to store styled cell addresses as variable, that can be used later by
        the data.

        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/tableStyledCell1.png" /></div>
        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/tableStyledCell2.png" /></div>

        <h4>Loop of ListItems</h4>

        To Loop items of a list use attribute <code-word>listItem</code-word> to define a list item index that
        shall be repeated. Similar to loops over table rows, the <code-word>${For}</code-word> and
        <code-word>${EndFor}</code-word> command has to surround a "real" list created by the (LibreOffice-)Application.
        The example below uses the <code-word>${Push}</code-word>-Command to define
        a variable "data" that contains a list of person objects.
        The <code-word>${For}</code-word>-command uses this "data"-list to extends the existing list.

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Example
            </th>
            <th>
              Expectation
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <no-br>${Push key:“data“, value:[</no-br><br>

              <no-br>&nbsp;&nbsp;{firstName: „Johanna“, lastName:“Sommer“},</no-br><br>
              <no-br>&nbsp;&nbsp;{firstName: „Helene“, lastName:“Jäger“}</no-br><br>
              ]}<br>
              <br>
              <no-br>${For $value:“data“, $as:“person“, listItem:0}</no-br><br>
              <no-br>&nbsp;<guide-b>1.</guide-b>&nbsp;${$person.firstName} ${$person.lastName}</no-br><br>
              ${EndFor}<br>
            </td>
            <td>
              <no-br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<guide-b>1.</guide-b>&nbsp;Hans Müller</no-br><br>
              <no-br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<guide-b>2.</guide-b>&nbsp;Johanna Sommer</no-br><br>
              <no-br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<guide-b>3.</guide-b>&nbsp;Helene Jäger</no-br><br>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>${$index} and &#x24;&#x7B;Counter&#x7D;-Command</h4>

        Within loops, the current item index will be stores in Variable <code-word>$index</code-word>. The
        first item will be associated with index 0. Because humans are use to count
        beginning with 1, the Command <code-word>${Counter}</code-word> prints out the index increased by one.

        <h3>${If}-Command</h3>

        The <code-word>${If}</code-word>-command is used to hide or show parts of the document. To define
        the visible area each <code-word>${If}</code-word>-command requires a corresponding
        <code-word>${EndIf}</code-word>-command.
        The visibility decision is made by the first attribute, which is a simple or complex condition
        that depends on variables or model values.
        A condition is a hierarchical structure of one or multiple condition elements.
        The next example shows the syntax of these condition elements:

        <pre class="padding"><code>// condition is true only when variable "v" contains value true
<guide-b>$v:true</guide-b>
// condition is false only when variable "v" contains value true
<guide-b>$v:false</guide-b>
// condition is true only when variable "v" contains string "x"          
<guide-b>$v:"x"</guide-b>
// condition is true only when variable "v" contains integer 42
<guide-b>$v:"42</guide-b>
// condition is true only when variable "v" is null or does not exist
<guide-b>$v:null</guide-b>
// condition is true only when variable "v" is an empty list
<guide-b>$v:[]</guide-b>

// condition is true when condition element within { } is false, otherwise true
<guide-b>not:{ ... }</guide-b>
// condition is only true when all comma separated condition elements
//within [ ] are true, otherwise false
<guide-b>and:[ ... ]</guide-b>
// condition is only true when at least one of the comma separated condition 
// elements within [ ] is true, otherwise false
<guide-b>or:[ ... ]</guide-b>
// condition is true when variable x is less then y
<guide-b>less:{$x:y}</guide-b>
// condition is true when variable x is greater then y
<guide-b>greater:{$x:y}</guide-b>
// condition is true when variable x is less or equal y
<guide-b>lessOrEqual:{$x:y}</guide-b>
// condition is true when variable x is greater or equal y
<guide-b>greaterOrEqual:{$x:y}</guide-b></code></pre>

        The next example box shows multiple if statements. The <code-word>${Push}</code-word>-command is
        used to define some example variables the if conditions will rely on.
        All "HIDDEN" texts will be invisible when Underdocx would interpret the following statements:

        <pre class="padding"><code>${Push key:"testString", value:"Test"}
${Push key:"testTrue", value:true}
${Push key:"testInt", value:3}

${If $testString:"Test"} VISIBLE ${EndIf}
${If $testString:"xyz"} HIDDEN ${EndIf}
${If $testTrue:true} VISIBLE ${EndIf}
${If $testTrue:false} HIDDEN ${EndIf}
${If not:{$testTrue:false}} VISIBLE ${EndIf}

${If and:[{$testString:"Test"},{$testTrue:true}]}
  VISIBLE
${EndIf}

${If and:[{$testString:"Test"},{not:{$testTrue:true}}]}
  HIDDEN
${EndIf}

${If or:[{$testString:"Test"},{$testTrue:false}]}
  VISIBLE
${EndIf}

${If or:[{$testString:"x"},{$testTrue:false}]}
  HIDDEN
${EndIf}

${If less:{$testInt:2}}
  VISIBLE
${EndIf}

${If less:{$testInt:3}}
  HIDDEN
${EndIf}

${If greater:{$testInt:4}}
  VISIBLE
${EndIf}

${If greater:{$testInt:3}}
  HIDDEN
${EndIf}</code></pre>


        <h3>${Import}-Command</h3>

        This command enables
        creation of reusable document-components that
        are imported into the main document. Imported document are usual
        document that also may contain placeholders that will be interpreted after
        the document has been imported. Note that only the main content of a component
        will be imported, footer or headers fill be ignored. ${Import} is currently
        not available for ODS documents. <code-word>$Import</code-word> offers
        different attributes to address a document that shall be imported:

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Attribute

              Attribute refers to a byte-Array that contains the binary data of the document
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              base64

                will be imported to the page that hold this command. When this attribute is missing all
                pages are imported.
            </td>
          </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    toPage
                </td>
                <td>
                    Optional: for ODG and ODP files select the target page name to import into
                </td>
            </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              beginFragmentRegex
            </td>
            <td>
              For TXT files this optional regular expression marks the start of a text fragment to import. The marked
              line is excluded

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              endFragmentRegex
            </td>
            <td>
              For TXT files this optional regular expression marks the end of a text fragment to import. The marked line
              is excluded
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        This example code create a document with different Import-Placeholders. All of them will be replaced
        by the content of the same document:

        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

              ${Import $data:"data"}
              ${Import $resource:"resource"}
              """.formatted("file:///home/User/doc1.odt");
      OdtContainer doc = new OdtContainer(content);
      OdtEngine engine = new OdtEngine();
      byte[] data = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(file));
      engine.pushLeafVariable("data", data);
      Resource resource = new Resource.FileResource(file);
      engine.pushLeafVariable("resource", resource);
      engine.run(doc);
      doc.createTmpFile("Test", false, null);
      doc.save(tmpFile);
  }
}</code></pre>

        <h3>${Export}-Command</h3>
        The <code-word>${Export}</code-word>-command is quite similar the <code-word>${Import}</code-word>-command, but
        it
        addresses a master-document that shall import the current document. That means
        the footer and header of the master document will be visible in the final document.
        When Attribute <code-word>name</code-word> and placeholder <code-word>${ExportTarget}</code-word> are not used,
        the content of the current document will be appended to the master document.
        ${Export} is currently only available for ODT documents.

        Exported pages in ODP and ODG document will be inserted after last page or after the page marked
          with <code-word>${ExportTarget}</code-word>. If required target pages have to be removed separately,
          see command <code-word>Remove</code-word>.

          <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Attribute</th>

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>${ExportTarget}-Command</h4>

        The master document may contain a <code-word>${ExportTarget}</code-word>-placeholders that shall receive the
        content of the current
        document that contains the <code-word>${Export}</code-word>-command. In this case, both the
        <code-word>${Export}</code-word> and
        <code-word>${ExportTarget}</code-word> placeholders have to use the <code-word>name</code-word> Attribute with
        an identical string value.

        <h3>${Image}-Command</h3>

        This command is a special placeholder, because it is not a plain textual command. Images placeholder are real
        images that are placed during template creation. An image becomes a placeholder image by adding
        the <code-word>${Image}</code-word> as description. This textual part of the placeholder is located
        in the "Description" field of the "Options"-tab of the "Properties..."-window of the image, which is selectable
        when you right-click the image.

          The attribute <code-word>keepWidth</code-word> is ignored for this kind of images.


          <h3>${CreateImage}-Command</h3>

          Command <code-word>CreateImage</code-word> enables creation of new images based on textual placeholders instead
          of existing images (see <code-word>${Image}</code-word>).
          To layout a new image by attributes is quite complex and can lead to invalid configurations, therefore
          try to use the <code-word>${Image}</code-word> command to replace an existing image if possible. On the
          other hand <code-word>CreateImage</code-word> enables dynamic image creation within (dynamic) text and
          provides more flexibility.

        <h3>${Alias}-Command</h3>

        An alias is a placeholder representing another placeholder and its parameters. It can be used
        to reduce complexity or
        to define new default parameters of the replaced placeholder. To support alias placeholders
        an alias definition has to be registered first.
        There are two ways to register new alias definitions, the <code-word>${Alias}</code-word>
        command and the method <code-word>registerAlias</code-word> of the Engine API, which might be
        the best way to hide complexity. In case you prefer alias definition in the document, the
        <code-word>${Alias}</code-word> command provides these attributes:

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Attribute
            </th>
            <th>
              Description
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>key</td>
            <td>placeholders that have this key will be replaced with "replaceKey"</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>replaceKey</td>
            <td>new key to use when a placeholder with "key" has been found</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>attributes</td>
            <td>This attribute is optional and contains an object of the default property key-value-pairs </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>attrReplacements</td>
            <td>This attribute is optional and contains an object of key-value-pairs of attribute shortcuts</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        An alias placeholder may still use parameters, even when the registered alias definition already defines
        the same parameters as default values. In this case the parameters of the alias definition are overwritten.

        <pre class="padding"><code>// alias definition
${Alias 
   key: "myDate", 
   replaceKey: "Date", 
   attributes: {outputFormat: "dd.MM.yyyy"}
   attrReplacements: {
     of:"outputFormat", 
     if:"inputFormat",
     v:"value"
   }
}

// prints current date similar to 2025-02-25
${Date}

// prints current date similar to 25.02.2025
${myDate}

// prints current date similar to 2025/02/25
${myDate of:"yyyy/MM/dd"}
          
// prints: 12.12.2024
${myDate v:"2024-12-12"}</code></pre>

       <h3>${Replace}-Command</h3>
          This command is similar to <code-word>${Alias}</code-word> command, but will replace all
          placeholders with a certain key by a provided text. All parameters of the replaced placeholder
          will be ignored.<br>
          <br>
          You can use this command to replace single short commands by a sequence of other more complex commands

          <table>
              <tr>
                  <th>
                      Attribute
                  </th>
                  <th>
                      Description
                  </th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>key</td>
                  <td>key of placeholders to replace</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>value</td>
                  <td>text to use for replacements. Don't forget escape sequences when replacing with other placeholders
                  </td>
              </tr>
          </table>

          <pre class="padding"><code>// replacement definition
${Replace
  key:"x",
  value:"${String value:\"Hallo\"} ${String value:\"Welt\"}"
}

// prints: Hallo Welt
${x}</code></pre>

          <h3>${Remove}-Command</h3>
        Removes the paragraph, page, text-box or table which contains this placeholder. In ODS, ODG and ODS documents
        you could use this command to create a temporary area with commands that will be removed in the
        final document. In this temporary area you can define ${Alias} commands or ${For} statements
        addressing remote tables. When attribute "name" is used, the table or page that has this name
          will be removed.

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Attribute
            </th>
            <th>
              Description
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>type of element that shall be removed, allowed values are page, table, box and paragraph </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>now</td>
            <td>if true, removal will be executed immediately. All following placeholders within the
              removed element will not be executed. Use now:false to let the template engine remove the element
              later
            </td>
          </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>name</td>
                <td>Optional: Remove the table or page that has this name. If not set the parent page, text-box or table
                    will be removed that contains this placeholder
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>${Clone}-Command</h3>
        Clones a page (slide) in ODG/ODP documents or a table in ODS documents.

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Attribute
            </th>
            <th>
              Description
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>name</td>
            <td>name of table or page (slide) to clone</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>newName</td>
            <td>new name to use for the cloned table or page</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>insertBefore</td>
            <td>optional: name of table or page to insert the cloned element before</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>${Copy}-Command</h3>
        Copies the content of a page (slide) in ODG/ODP documents into another

        <table>
          <tr>

              Attribute
            </th>
            <th>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>to</td>
            <td>name to target page</td>
          </tr>
        </table>        

          <h3>${Create}-Command</h3>
          Creates a new empty page (ODG, ODP).
          <table>
              <tr>
                  <th>
                      Attribute
                  </th>
                  <th>
                      Description
                  </th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>name</td>
                  <td>name of the new page (slide) to create</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>type</td>
                  <td>type has to be "page"</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>master</td>
                  <td>master of the page (slide), default is "Default"</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>insertBefore</td>
                  <td>optional: name of page to insert the created element before</td>
              </tr>
          </table>


        <h3>${PageStyle}-Command</h3>

        In ODT document, page breaks, page-orientation-changes and new page numbers can be forced with
        the <code-word>${PageStyle}</code-word>-command. To understand this command it is important to understand how
        ODT handles pages breaks with page style changes. First of all there are to types of page break
        - "Before": The page break will be inserted before this paragraph/placeholder begins (default)
        - "After" The page break will be inserted after this paragraph (not recommended)<br>
        <br>
        Only page breaks of type "Before" can define/change the page style to use for the next page.
        And only page breaks with explicit page style can change the page number. You can try it
        in LibreOffice Write by manually editing the page break:

        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/PageBreakWithPageStyle.png" /></div>

        All available page styles can be shown or edited in the styles view (Press F11 and select button "Page Styles").
        Here you can also add custom page styles with different header and footers.

        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/MyPageStyle.png" /></div>

        The <code-word>${PageStyle}</code-word>-command acts like this LibreOffice Writer component:

        <div class="imageContainer"><img src="images/guide/PageBreakWithPageStyleZoom.png" /></div>

        Therefore you can use these attributes:

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Attribute</th>
            <th>Values</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>pageBreakAfter (ODT only)</td>
            <td>true/false</td>
            <td>if true, a page break is inserted after this paragraph </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>pageBreakBefore (ODT only)</td>
            <td>true/false</td>
            <td>if true, a page break is inserted before this paragraph (recommended)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>masterPage (ODT/ODP/ODG)</td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>only allowed when pageBreakBefore is true, sets the new page style for the page after the break</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>pageNumber (ODT only)r</td>
            <td>Integer</td>
            <td>only allowed when masterPage is set, reset the page number for the page after the break </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        When the <code-word>${PageStyle}</code-word>-command is used in a document that will be exported
        to a master document by the <code-word>${Export}</code-word>-command, ensure attribute
        <code-word>masterPage</code-word> uses
        a style name that is defined in the master document.<br>
        <br>
          Command <code-word>${PageStyle}</code-word> can also be used for presentations and graphics (ODP/ODG),
          but only attribute <code-word>masterPage</code-word> is supported.



        <h3>&#x24;&#x7B;Push&#x7D;-Command / &#x24;&#x7B;Pop&#x7D;-Command</h3>

        The <code-word>${Push}</code-word>-command allows definition of variables within the document. It
        can also be used to copy a variables or model nodes. Technically spoken all new variables
        are pushed onto a stack, that means the previous variable value will not be
        overwritten but becomes hidden by the new one. The <code-word>${Pop}</code-word>-command removes
        a variable value from the stack and makes the previous value visible again.
        Underdocx uses this stack to ensure the <code-word>$index</code-word> always represent
        the current index in the current loop, even when loops are nested.<br>
        <br>
        The <code-word>${Push}</code-word>-command provides two mandatory attributes

        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Attribute</td>
            <td>Description</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>key</td>
            <td>Name of the variable. You can access another variable or model node to read out the name </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>value</td>
            <td>Variable value to store. You can access an other variable or model node to read out the value </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        The <code-word>${Pop}</code-word>-command only support the attribute <code-word>key</code-word> to address the
        variable that shall be removed
        from the stack.

        <h3>${Calc}-Command</h3>
        Use this command to add, subtract, multiply and divide two values and store
        the result as variable. Here are the attributes of the command:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Attribute</th>
            <th>Allowed values</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>a</td>
            <td>Double, Integer or Long</td>
            <td>First value to calculate with</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>b</td>
            <td>Double, Integer or Long</td>
            <td>Second value to calculate with</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>operator</td>
            <td>"+", "-", "/", "*"</td>
            <td>The calculation method</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>key</td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>Name of variable to store the result</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        Examples:
        <pre class="padding"><code>${Push key:"i", value:4}

// prints 6
${Calc key:"x", $a:"i", operator:"+", b:2}${$x}

// prints 8.0
${Calc key:"x", a:2.0, operator:"*", $b:"i"}${$x}</code></pre>

        <h3>${Concat}-Command</h3>
        You can combine multiple values and add them in a variable as list or as concatenated string
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Attribute</th>
            <th>Allowed values</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>a</td>
            <td>Number or String</td>
            <td>First value to concatenate</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>b</td>
            <td>Number or String</td>
            <td>Second value to concatenate</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>c</td>
            <td>Number or String</td>
            <td>Third value to concatenate</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>d</td>
            <td>Number or String</td>
            <td>Fourth value to concatenate</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>e</td>
            <td>Number or String</td>
            <td>Fifth value to concatenate</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>"string" or "list"</td>
            <td>Store elements as list or combine them in a single string</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>key</td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>Variable name to store the result list or string</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>${Ignore}-Command</h3>
        Lets the engine ignore all following commands/placeholders until <code-word>${EndIgnore}</code-word> command is reached.

        <h3>${Exit}-Command</h3>
          Stops interpretation of all following placeholders.

        <h3>${Model}-Command</h3>

        This command is used to test the current model position / current model node. It is internally used by
        Underdocx to realize For-Loop by copying the content of the loop multiple times and setting the model
        position before and after every repeat.

        In case you want to change the model position the <code-word>${Model}</code-word> command provides these
        attributes:

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Attribute</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>interpret</td>
            <td>set the model position according to the model path relatively to the current position.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>value</td>
            <td>set the model position according to the absolute model path </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>activeModelPathPrefix</td>
            <td>registers a prefix that has to be used in model paths (see *as in for-loops)</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Placeholder Styles</h2>
        You can change the syntax style of placeholders by implementing your own style or by
        using predefined styles. Changing the placeholder style might help you to
        edit (text) templates. The TxtEngine can use <code-word>TxtPlaceholderStyle</code-word> that
        provides styles <code-word>DOUBLE-BRACKETS</code-word>, <code-word>XML-COMMENT</code-word>, <code-word>CODE-COMMENT</code-word> and
        <code-word>HASH-COMMENT</code-word>.

        <h3>XML-Comment Style</h3>
        Use the XML-Comment style to hide the commands in XML comments.
        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-xml hljs" data-lang="xml">&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;!--${For value:["Hans", "Otto", "Gerda"], $as:"item"}--&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;!--${$item}--&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;!--${EndFor}--&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

          <h3>Double-Brackets Style</h3>
          This placeholder style is derived from the mustache-template-engine placeholder syntax.
          <pre
                  class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="python">{{Join value:["Bibi", "Tina", "Amadeus", "Sabrina"]}} {{Date value:"2022-02-02"}}</code></pre>


          <h3>Code-Comment Style</h3>
        Use the Code-Comment Style to hide the commands in language-comments as used in Java, TypeScript, C++ etc.
        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class Test {
    /*!For $value:"entries", $as:"item"!*/
    /*!$item!*/
    /*!EndFor!*/
}</code></pre>

        <h3>Hash-Comment Style</h3>
        Use the Hash-Comment Style to hide the commands in language-comments as used in Bash or Python
        <pre
          class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-python hljs" data-lang="python">#!Join value:["Bibi", "Tina", "Amadeus", "Sabrina"]!# #!Date value:"2022-02-02"!#</code></pre>

        <h2>PDF Generation</h2>

        You can use Underdocx to convert ODT files into PDF.<br>
        <br>

        Class <code-word>OdfContainer</code-word> which is a superclass of <code-word>OdtContainer</code-word> provides
        method <code-word>writePDF(OutputStream os)</code-word> so save the document as PDF.<br>
        <br>

        Underdocx uses an existing installation of LibreOffice to convert a document into PDF.
        Ensure environment variable <code-word>LIBREOFFICE</code-word> contains the path of the LibreOffice
        installation,
        for example "C:/Program Files/LibreOffice/program/soffice.exe" on windows.

        <h2>Command Line Interface (CLI)</h2>

        When Underdocx is fed with the template document and all required data, it can
        build the final document without use of the API. Unfortunately there is currently no download
        available for the CLI tool, therefore you need to build the CLI version manually

        <h3>Build Underdocx as CLI Tool</h3>
        You need "git", "JDK" and "Maven" to build your CLI variant of underdocx. When these tools are installed
        type these commands:

        <pre class="padding"><code>git clone https://github.com/winterrifier/underdocx.git
cd underdocx
mvn clean install -P buildCli</code></pre>
        After execution there will be a target folder that contains "underdocx-0.12.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar".
        You can use this jar file as CLI tool.

        <h3>Usage of CLI</h3>
        To call Underdocx by CLI use this syntax:
        <pre
          class="padding"><code>java -jar underdocx-0.12.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar &lt;engineType&gt; &lt;templateFile&gt; &lt;outFile&gt; [dataJsonFile1] [dataJsonFile2] ...</code></pre>
        For example:
        <pre
          class="padding"><code>java -jar underdocx-0.12.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar ODT template.odt out.odt data.json</code></pre>
          Note: It is also possible to add custom Placeholder/Command implementations (see section Custom Extensions).
        Implement interface <code-word>EngineProvider</code-word>,
        include your classes to the classpath, execute <code-word>UnderdocxEngineRunder</code-word> as main class and
        use the qualified
        class name of your provider as first argument (instead of ODT)
        <h3>Underdocx Json format</h3>
        The optional Json files (last arguments) contains all data the Template Engine requires to fill the template document. It
        may contain
        the data model, variables, alias definitions and String replacements. The schema is as follows:
        <pre class="padding"><code>{
  variables: { key1:value1, key2:value2, ... }, // values may be complex JSON values
  model: {...}, // model data tree
  stringReplacements:{ key1:repl1, key2:repl2, ... }, // simple placeholder replacements
  alias: [
    { 
      key:key1, 
      replaceKey:replaceKey1, 
      attributes: {att1:value1, att2:value2, ...},
      attrReplacements: {attr1:replaceAttr1, att2:replaceAttr2, ...}
    }, ...
  ]
}</code></pre>
Note: When multiple data files are used, the data of a json file might overwrite data of a previous file,
          for example if variables have the same name or multiple models are specified.


        <h2>Custom Extensions</h2>

        Underdocx has been designed of extendability.
        You can change the syntax of placeholders and add custom placeholders
        and functionalities in different ways.

        <h3>Custom Placeholders</h3>

        A simple way to add custom placeholders is to add a new custom "key" as command that
        will be replaced by another more complex command. This allows you to hide complexity
        behind simple placeholders. For example, you can import another sub document
        using the <code-word>${Import}</code-word> command and hide the functionality bind the custom command
        <code-word>${ReportTable}</code-word><br>
        <br>

        The engine provides method <code-word>registerStringReplacement</code-word> to register such replacements.
        Note: All replacements will be performed in the document when the engine detects
        the first alias placeholder.<br>
        <br>

        The following example creates a custom <code-word>${Begin}</code-word>- and
        <code-word>${End}</code-word>-command
        that will be replaced by
        a predefined more complex <code-word>${For}</code-word> and <code-word>${EndFor}</code-word> command.

        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">String documentStr = """
            <guide-b>${Begin}</guide-b>
              ${$index} ${$element} 
            <guide-b>${End}</guide-b>
          """;
OdtContainer doc = new OdtContainer(documentStr);
OdtEngine engine = new OdtEngine();
engine.registerStringReplacement(<guide-b>"Begin"</guide-b>, 
  "${For value:[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], $as:\"element\"} ");
engine.registerStringReplacement(<guide-b>"End"</guide-b>, "${EndFor}");
engine.run(doc);</code></pre>

        <h3>Custom Handlers</h3>

        CommandHandlers can be written and registered at the engine. They receive detected placeholders
        and an API to modify the document DOM if they "feel responsible" for the provided placeholder. Usually these
        CommandHandlers read out the attributes of the placeholder and pass the collected information to a
        so called Modifier that is responsible to manipulate the internal document DOM.

        <h4>Example: Custom &#x24;&#x7B;Add&#x7D;-Command</h4>

        The next example defines a custom CommandHandler hat adds two attribute <code-word>a</code-word> and
        <code-word>b</code-word> and
        stores the sum in a variable defined by attribute <code-word>target</code-word>.
        The <code-word>AddCommandHandler</code-word> extends class <code-word>AbstractTextualCommandHandler</code-word>
        and uses
        <code-word>ExtendedDataPicker</code-word> instances that read out the attributes of the placeholder.
        The result is stored in the variable stack with help of the provided <code-word>DataAccess</code-word>
        instance.
        The <code-word>${Add}</code-word> placeholder itself will be deleted by the
        <code-word>DeletePlaceholderModifier</code-word> that
        receives the DOM-Node that represent the handled placeholder.
        The <code-word>AddCommandHandler</code-word> is registered at the engine by calling the
        <code-word>registerParametersCommandHandler</code-word> method.<br>
        <br>
        This example creates a document that initially contains the <code-word>${Add}</code-word> -command to add two
        values (2+3). After
        execution the document will just contain the calculated sum (5).

        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class AddExample {

  private static class AddCommandHandler extends AbstractTextualCommandHandler&lt;OdtContainer, OdfTextDocument&gt; {
      protected AddCommandHandler() {
          super(new Regex("Add"));
      }

      @Override
      protected CommandHandlerResult tryExecuteTextualCommand() {
          int aValue = getAttr(new IntegerDataPicker().expectedAttr("a"));
          int bValue = getAttr(new IntegerDataPicker().expectedAttr("b"));
          String target = getAttr(new StringConvertDataPicker().expectedAttr("target"));
          int result = aValue + bValue;
          dataAccess.pushVariable(target, new LeafDataNode&lt;&gt;(result));
          new OdfDeletePlaceholderModifier().modify(selection.getNode(), DeletePlaceholderModifierData.DEFAULT);
          return CommandHandlerResult.EXECUTED_PROCEED;
      }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
      String content = """
              ${Add a:2, b:3, target:"sum"}
              ${$sum}
              """;
      OdtContainer doc = new OdtContainer(content);
      OdtEngine engine = new OdtEngine();
      engine.registerParametersCommandHandler(new AddCommandHandler());
      engine.run(doc);
      File tmpFile = File.createTempFile("Test_", ".odt");
      doc.save(tmpFile);
      System.out.println("Document created: %s".formatted(tmpFile));
  }
};</code></pre>

        <h3>Custom Syntax</h3>

        To define custom placeholders with custom syntax, you have to implements
        the <code-word>PlaceholdersProvider</code-word> and it's <code-word>PlaceholderProvider.Factory</code-word>
        interfaces.
        There are some base classes you can reuse as done in the example below. For example
        the <code-word>RegexExtractor</code-word> finds text sequences in the document by passing a
        regular expression, the <code-word>TextualPlaceholderToolkit</code-word> simplifies
        placeholder node handling, and the <code-word>AbstractOdfPlaceholdersProviderFactory</code-word>
        uses these helpers to create the <code-word>PlaceholdersProvider</code-word>.<br>
        <br>

        The example below also defines a custom <code-word>UpperCaseCommandHandler</code-word> that accepts placeholders
        provided by the custom <code-word>MyPlaceholdersProvider</code-word>. It provides all word beginning with
        <code-word>&lt;</code-word> and ending with </code-word>&gt;</code-word>. The
        <code-word>UpperCaseCommandHandler</code-word> takes the placeholder payload,
        converts it in uppercase, and replaces the placeholder with the converted text.<br>
        <br>

        The main method of the example creates a document
        that initially contains text <code-word>Hello &lt;name&gt;</code-word>, which will modified to <code-word>Hello
          NAME</code-word>.
        <pre class="highlightjs highlight nowrap"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">public class CustomPlaceholderExample {
